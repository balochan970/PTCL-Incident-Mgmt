# Duplicate Incident Prevention Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to prevent duplicate incident submissions in the PTCL Incident Management System.

## Server-Side Changes

### API Routes
- Enhanced duplicate prevention in API routes with robust hash generation
- Increased submission timeout from 5 to 30 seconds
- Added Firestore checks for recent submissions (within 5 minutes)
- Implemented proper error handling and response codes
- Added submission hash tracking in the database

## Client-Side Changes

### Incident Service
- Created a dedicated service for incident creation with built-in duplicate prevention
- Implemented client-side caching of recent submissions
- Added proper error handling and type definitions

### Form Submission Handling
- Added debounce functionality to prevent rapid multiple clicks
- Disabled submit buttons during submission
- Implemented proper loading states and error handling
- Created a custom hook for standardized form submission handling

## Implementation Details

### Duplicate Prevention Mechanisms
1. **Button Disabling**: Submit buttons are disabled during form submission
2. **Client-Side Caching**: Recent submissions are tracked in memory
3. **Server-Side Caching**: Recent submissions are tracked in memory on the server
4. **Database Checks**: Recent submissions are verified against Firestore
5. **Submission Hash**: Each submission has a unique hash for identification

### Performance Considerations
- Minimal impact on user experience
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- Efficient memory usage with timeouts for cache clearing

## Testing
To test the duplicate prevention:
1. Fill out an incident form
2. Click the submit button multiple times rapidly
3. Verify only one incident is created
4. Submit the same exact data again within 5 minutes
5. Verify no duplicate incident is created
